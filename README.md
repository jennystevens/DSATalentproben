# DSATalentproben
This is a standalone Windows Forms Tool to automate skillchecks for Das Schwarze Auge roleplaying game. It is purely a hobby project and taylored to my group's specific set of houserules, though the core mechanic should be easy enough to adapt.

# Usage
The app can be run/built via Visual Studio. For testing, load the Testheld.xml from the "Testheld" folder.
